# Code Challenge 1
This is the answer for the string compression and uri comparison.

## How to run the source code 
First question:

    $ node compress.js

I have 5 unit test cases: One from zendesk question, another longer string, two very simple strings, and two edge cases (which return empty strings). The output of the strings should be as follows:

    a4b2a4b1a1b3c12
    a13l8d3f3e8b8e1g8a1b2a4b1a1b3c27
    a1
    a1b1c1
    
    
    ..


Second Question:

	$ node uriComparison.js
	
Similarly I have 7 unit test cases.  The result is:

	true
	true
	true
	true
	false
	true
	false
	
There are also some unit tests commented out for the helper methods in the file.
